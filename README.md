## Well, What’s Drizzle?

Drizzle is an Airdrop Tool #onFlow! Anyone can use it to create an airdrop (FT only now) in a minute!

## How to use Drizzle?

Create a DROP, share the link to your community, that’s all!

With drizzle, you can decide who is eligible for your rewards by using our different modes.

- FLOAT Event. You can limit the eligibility to people who own FLOATs of specific FLOAT Event at the time of the DROP being created.
- FLOAT Group. You can also limit the eligibility to people who own FLOATs in a FLOAT Group. You can set a threshold to the number of FLOATs the users should have.
- Whitelist. You can upload a whitelist. Only accounts on the whitelist are eligible for rewards.
- And, you can set a capacity to your DROP, which means the DROP is seats-limited.

For setting the amount of reward, you have two choices as well:

- Identical: All claimers will get identical amount of reward.
- Random: The claimers will get a random amount of reward (the range should be from 0.00000001 to (2.0 * the available amount / the available capacity - 0.00000001)). To simplify user interaction, the implementation of this mode is a bit naive and someone might get a higher reward by using “Try & Abort”, so please use it for fun only.

Besides, we have a “Whitelist With Amount” mode, with which you can set a specific reward amount to each account on the whitelist manually.

## Roadmap

More features are to be added soon. (NFT airdrop to be the next one!)
